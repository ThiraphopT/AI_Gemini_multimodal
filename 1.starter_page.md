You are a Marketing Campaign Coordinator at a media company, working closely with the Marketing Manager to plan, execute, and evaluate campaigns to meet sales targets. Recently, you secured an exciting new contract with Google. As a Marketing Campaign Coordinator, you’re eager to dive into the materials that will help you familiarize yourself with the Google brand and Google brand identity as quickly as possible. Therefore, you plan to review Google’s brand guidelines, previous campaigns, product ads, customer testimonials, and financial reports by leveraging Gemini’s innovative capabilities to gain deeper insights into Google more efficiently.

In this challenge, you begin with multimodal prompts to extract information from text and visual data, generating a video description, and retrieving extra information beyond the video by using multimodality with Gemini. You also build metadata of documents containing text and images, getting all relevant text chunks, and printing citations by using Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Gemini.
